### Description

HELP WITH PRIORITY QUEUES. This small application was inspired by the request for help by R Al-shaer. Imagine a number of patients waiting in an emergency room of a local hospital. Priority is related to the seriousness of the patient's condition.

(1 = most serious, 4 = least serious).

We assume that a doctor spends 60 minutes with a patient whose priority is 1, 45 minutes for priority 2, 30 minutes for priority 3 and 15 minutes with a patient whose priority is 4.

The patient's treatment is not interrupted, even if a more serious case arrives. Two Doctors are on call. Dr. Alpha starts seeing patients at 6:00 and Dr. Beta starts at 6:30. The programs goal is to list the patients in the order in which they will be treated.
